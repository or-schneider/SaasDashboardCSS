# SaasDashboardCSS

Pure css implementation of a saas dashboard design  
The design is courtesy of Figma's open designs  
Built for css practice and to serve as a future reference

#### Notes

Responsiveness is taken into account  
Flex ftw  
Having named classes on elements makes navigating the project from the browser incredibly easy,  
when compared to the Bootstrap type of experience
